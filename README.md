### Rocket Control System

All the files starting by *RC* are actual project, and each one of them is explained here:

- *RC_dCedCoAlm.mat*: Data file containing two variables generated by *RC_DirectionsAlm.m* and used for comparison by *RC_DirectionsEqu.m* and *RC_DirectionsNorthPole.m*.

- *RC_DirectionsAlm.m*: Script that calculates and plots deviation in a shot from Almeria as a function of angle.

- *RC_DirectionsEqu.m*: Same as the previous one, but from the equator.

- *RC_DirectionsEqu.m*: Same as the previous one, but from the North Pole.

- *RC_FrictR.m*: Calculates and plots distance as a function of the drag constant (k).

- *RC_FrictV.m*: Calculates and plots velocity as a function of the time for three different drag constants (k1, k2, k3).

- *RC_Moon.m*: Script used for generic plotting and calculation of trajectories on the Moon.

- *RC_RK2.m*: Modified 2nd order Runge-Kutta function. Used to integrate r(t) and v(t).

- *RocketControl.m*: Basic script of the project. Used for generic plotting of trajectories and a variety of calculations.
